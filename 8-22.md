###Sequence/Linear data structure
- array
	- single contiguous block
	- random access
	- fixed size
- linked list
	- pointers to separate memory locations
	- sequential access
	- dynamically allocated space
- dynamic array (Vector, arrayList)
	- single block
	- random access
	- dynamic (by reinitializing the array in a new location)
