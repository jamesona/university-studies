# Amino Acid structures

**Primary**
A chain of amino acids

**Secondary**
Mutiple chains connecting together
- alpha helix
- beta sheet

**Tertiary**
Folded proteins created by R group interactions

**Quaternary**
Combinations of proteins through external R group interactions

**Denaturing**: removing or preventing R group interactions 


# Nucleic Acids
DNA is a 5-carbon sugar, with a hydroxyl group on the third carbon (de-oxy: removed oxygen ribose);
RNA has hydroxyl on both the third and the second (regular ribose).
A phosphorous group is attached to the fifth carbon, with a nitrogenous base (adenine) on the first.
