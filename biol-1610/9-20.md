**Catabolic** 
- exergonic: produces energy
- spontaneous reaction
- will be a negative delta G reaction

**Anabolic**
- exergonic: requires energy
- nonspontaneous
- positive delta G reaction

###Enzyme Inhibition
competitive inhibitor: attatches to the active site; takes the place of the enzyme on the receptor.
non-competitive inhibitor: attataches to an allosteric site; changes the receptor to disallow the enzyme.


**REDOX reactions**
- **LEO** Lose electron: oxidation
- **GER** Gain electron: reduction
